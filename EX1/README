                                Markov Chain Tweet Generator

This program generates random tweets based on a given text corpus using a Markov Chain model.
It simulates how words transition into each other based on their frequency and proximity in the input data.

Files
markov_chain.c: Contains the logic for the Markov Chain implementation, including node and database handling,
as well as tweet generation. tweets_generator.c: The main driver program that reads the text file,
initializes the Markov Chain, and generates random tweets.

Overview
The program works by:

1.Reading a text file line by line.
2.Tokenizing the text into words.
3.Constructing a Markov Chain where each word is a node.
4.Building a frequency list to determine how often one word follows another.
5.Generating random tweets by randomly selecting words based on their transition frequencies.

Requirements
* C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
* Standard C Libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, time.h, etc.)

Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wvla -std=c99 tweets_generator.c markov_chain.c linked_list.c -o tweets_generator

This command compiles tweets_generator.c along with markov_chain.c and linked_list.c to generate the executable
tweets_generator.


Usage
Command-line Arguments
The program requires four command-line arguments:
./tweets_generator <seed> <max_length> <file_path> <num_tweets>

<seed>: An integer seed to initialize the random number generator. This controls the randomness of the tweet generation.
<max_length>: The maximum length of each generated tweet (number of words).
<file_path>: The path to the text file (corpus) from which to build the Markov Chain.
<num_tweets>: The number of tweets to generate.

Example Command
./tweets_generator 42 10 "input.txt" 5
This will generate 5 tweets, each with a maximum length of 10 words, using the input text file input.txt and a random
seed of 42.

Sample Output
Tweet 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Tweet 2: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.
Tweet 3: The sky is blue and the grass is green.
